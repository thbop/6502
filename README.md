# 6502 Emulator:

## Description:
**Please note that this project is currently unfinished!**

The 6502 is a CPU used in many older computers; most notably the NES. The goal of this project is emulate most (if not all) of the logic in the 6502.
An added benefit is that I get to learn much about the 6502 and its inner workings while also learning about general CPU architecture in general (not to mention this is my first major C++ project).

Example using assembled code to draw a grid and move a cursor via arrow keys.

## Program Architecture:
The original design and functionality is completely copied from [@Dave Poo](https://github.com/davepoo)'s video found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJgsuQoy9bc

Yet, I completely branched away from [his project](https://github.com/davepoo/6502Emulator) after the first video and implemented my own (modified) structure.
